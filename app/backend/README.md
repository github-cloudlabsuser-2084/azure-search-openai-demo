# Documentation for `app/backend/` Directory

The `app/backend/` directory contains the backend code for the application. It is primarily written in Python.

## Main Files

- **`main.py`**: This is the main entry point for the backend application. It initializes the application and starts the server.

- **`prepdocs.py`**: This script is used for preparing the documents for the application. It might include tasks such as parsing, cleaning, and formatting the documents.

- **`text.py`**: This file likely contains functions related to text processing, such as text extraction, tokenization, and text analysis.

- **`approach.py`**: This file contains the `Approach` class which is used to handle the search and OpenAI operations. It takes in several parameters including a search client, an OpenAI client, an authentication helper, and various settings related to language processing and embeddings.

## Requirements Files

- **`requirements.in`** and **`requirements.txt`**: These files list the Python packages that are required to run the backend application. `requirements.in` is typically used to specify high-level dependencies, while `requirements.txt` is used to pin specific versions of all dependencies (including transitive ones) for reproducible builds.
